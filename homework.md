# CodeClan Library

## Brief

Your task is to create a command line management system for CodeClan Library. You have been given a small amount of code that forms the basic structure of the program and you will have to write the code to complete the functionality.

The start code contains some data - the name of the library and the books that are contained within the library. Each book has an author and title.

The management system should be able to:

### MVP

1. Print out a welcome statement including the name of the library. Make sure you access the name through the Dictionary, rather than hard-coding it into the string.

2. List all of the books within the the library. You should list both the title and author of each book.

3. Allow the user to search for a book by entering its title. Display the author and title of the book to the user. If the book is not found then a separate message should be displayed to the user.

4. Allow the user to add a new book to the library by entering a title and author.

5. Allow the user to remove a book by entering its title. If the title does not match a book within the library then a message should be displayed to the user.

#### Extension

6. Allow the user to update an existing book by entering its title and then new values for the title and author. If the user does not enter a value for either the title or author, then the value should not be changed.

### Approach

You may find it useful to pseudocode a solution to each problem before you begin writing it in Python.
